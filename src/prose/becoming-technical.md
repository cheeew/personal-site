> “I wish I knew how to code.”

If you’ve ever thought this to yourself, this post is for you—but not only you.

This post is also for those interested in learning how I think and my general outlook toward pursuing life. While _Becoming technical_ largely derives from experiences pertaining to my professional endeavors, each section is also illustrative of underpinning principles that coincide with my personal life pursuits.

So, even though this post is geared toward _becoming technical_, you’ll find the overall undertone of this piece alludes to _becoming more_.

If this sounds like your type of thing, settle in.

I hope you enjoy.

## The extraction

Wanting to learn to code is an interesting aspiration.

It’s a skill that’s incredibly accessible, yet—at the same time—continues to feel so esoteric amongst the masses. Today, resources geared toward learning how to code are ubiquitous. It’s quite remarkable, in fact. Between GitHub, YouTube, Medium, personal blogs, bootcamps, MOOCs, etc., the development community has captured a pervading vibrancy that feels unparalleled by any other vertical.

Though, with the number of educational resources roaming around the physical and digital streets, I’d expect a more saturated pool of techies. Perhaps, a little more time is required, or maybe it’s just me.

I believe doubt is what, largely, preserves software’s obscurity and what prevents more people from entering its arena. It’s easy to feel unqualified as a future software developer or engineer, if you’ve lacked a natural curiosity for computers earlier in life. It can even feel like, if computers didn’t strike an interest with you early on then it wasn’t meant to be. Or it can even seem that technology is only reserved for those with gifted minds.

Whatever your thought may be, it’s important you know this: you’re entirely wrong.

If there is anything to take away from this initial introduction, it’s that anyone is capable of becoming technical.

So, if you have an inclination of doubting your own capabilities, you’re now free to extract those thoughts.

They are utterly useless to you.

## The feeding grounds

Everyone aspires, but not everyone acts.

You may not necessarily carry doubts when it comes to a specific goal, but you might not bear the necessary assurance either.

Becoming technical is a demanding task. It requires time, persistence and a consistent effort. People do it all the time, though. And knowing that is key.

If you want some search-engine-fast proof as to how attainable becoming technical is, just google “How I became a developer.” You’ll find a sizable number of stories of people with minimal to no technical computing experience who now work full-time technology roles.

These types of stories are powerful. It’s astonishing how much impact one or two anecdotes can have on a person. I can recall two particular narratives that took me from “I wish I knew how to code” to coding everyday:

- <a href="https://www.learnenough.com/story" class='anecdote'>The learn enough story</a>: This piece of content alone is what inspired much of my own technical pursuit. This single page took me from subconscious uncertainty to a fresh new “you can do this” set of eyes. In short, this is the post that dangled the carrot in front of my face.
- <a href="https://medium.freecodecamp.org/graphic-designer-to-front-end-developer-7be7bfd6a46c" class='anecdote'>How I transitioned from a graphic designer to front-end developer in 5 months</a>: If _The learn enough story_ is what strung the carrot in front of my face, this is the anecdote that provided me with that initial push forward--my accelerator. The author walks you through his background, his reasons as to why he wanted to learn to code, his self-contrived work processes, in addition to sharing numerous resources he found valuable within his own journey. Oh, and spoiler alert, he got the job.

It’s important to become inspired when pursuing something new. Aspirations are fickle and easily wither if you don’t feed them. So, avoid starving your yearnings.

The only thing you’ll reap in return is inaction.

## The tedious slog

When you’re new, tech can be cryptic and intimidating. But once you’ve gained some familiarity, most things will seem feasible within reasonable time. This doesn’t mean that things become easy, though. Previous struggles will most certainly become easier; however, software will always be frustrating. There is no getting around that.

Now, that may sound daunting to the foreigner, but let me reassure you: it’s not. Enduring that inexorable crux is what engenders camaraderie amidst teams--because we’ve all been there and we’ll be there again. Frustration does not discriminate within the tech world and, believe it or not, that’s encouraging.

 <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">20+ yrs dev exp, 8 books w/ 100k+ copies sold, 300k+ hours watched of my videos, 4k+ taught in person...<br><br>And you know what? I still struggle to get my code to work and it&#39;s still a tedious slog. And my code still confuses me the next day.<br><br>You&#39;re not alone in these struggles.</p>&mdash; getify (@getify) <a href="https://twitter.com/getify/status/972495616600293381?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 10, 2018</a></blockquote>

You can’t help but to feel a little better about yourself when Kyle Simpson—author of the _You don’t know JS_ book series—states even he struggles with his own code from time to time.

Former professional cyclist, Greg LeMond, captured this same notion in a rather terse fashion:

> “It never gets easier, you just go faster.”<br><br>
> _-Greg LeMond_

So, whether you’re six months, one year, or five years into your technical trek, if certain things still don’t make sense to you, don’t feel bad.

Just remember: you’re a professional cyclist.

## The endless summit

When it comes to technology, it’s best to quickly realize no one knows everything. When you sign up to become technical you inadvertently enroll in the “Lifelong learners club.”

And, by the way, on Wednesdays, we wear black.

Dress code aside, it’s important to remind yourself of that lifelong commitment level every once in a while. If you don’t, you risk becoming discouraged or, even worse, domineering. And no one likes to work with the latter.

So, if you’re searching for a grand summit where you remove your shoes, cease all climbing and perennially relish, prepare for disappointment.

Because, much like life, the best part is always the ascent—not the advent.

Happy hacking.
